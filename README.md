# Analysis-Unlocking-Rome
## Introduction
The rise of short-term rental platforms like Airbnb has reshaped urban housing markets. This project analyzes rental listings in Rome to understand host behaviors, property characteristics, and market trends.


## Context
We focus on Rome's rental listings data, including information on hosts, property types, prices, availability, and guest reviews. Our goal is to uncover patterns that help hosts optimize their offerings and inform policymakers about the impact of short-term rentals.


## Key Questions
Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain? 
What was the average rental duration for all videos? 
Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in? 
Where are customers with a high lifetime value based? 
Do sales figures vary between geographic regions? 
Top Hosts: Who manages the most listings?
Property Types: What are the characteristics and distribution of different room types?
Locations: Where are the listings concentrated, and how do prices and ratings vary by neighborhood?
Booking Trends: When are properties most frequently booked, and how do minimum stay requirements affect bookings?


## Objectives
Host Activity: Identify and visualize top hosts and the distribution of their listings.
Property Characteristics: Analyze room type distribution, ratings, prices, and availability.
Neighborhood Analysis: Map listings by neighborhood and examine price and rating variations.
Booking Trends: Identify seasonal booking patterns and the impact of minimum stay requirements.

## Stakeholders
